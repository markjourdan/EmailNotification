# Project Description
The Email Notification wrapper makes it easier for .NET developers to wire up emails using fluent configuration. You'll no longer have to manually setup the email service and handle possible exceptions. It's developed in C#.NET.

Email Notification can be configured fluently, or through the app.config or web.config. Please refer to the Documentation for more advanced configuration options.
